# LIGHT-DETECTOR-USING-NAND-GATE
A light detector using a NAND gate can be built by connecting an LDR and a fixed resistor in a voltage divider configuration, with the junction serving as one input to the NAND gate. The LDRâ€™s resistance decreases as light intensity increases, altering the input voltage.
